To increase the size of `adapt_thresh`, `regrid` interpolates the data onto a larger grid, calculates the mask on the larger grid, then interpolates the mask at the original image size.\n",

Its behaviour can be controlled using `border_kwargs`, where the size of a NaN region (`size`), size of the filter used to define noisy edges (`filt_width`), and the number of times to apply that filter (`eros_iter`) can be controlled.\n",

But if the filaments are closely packed together, this can severely limit the number of points used to make the profile. `pad_to_distance` forces all pixels within the given distance to be included in the profile. Must be given in length units and be less than `max_dist`.\n",

However, FilFinder uses the [astropy.modeling](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/modeling/) package and will accept any 1D astropy model. For example, the [radfil](https://github.com/catherinezucker/radfil) package has an astropy implementation of a Plummer model, which could be used here.\n",
